This is an interactive fiction about making pancakes on a Saturday
morning.

It was written using [Inform 7][] [release 6L38][]. It is possible that it
may not compile on future releases, because the language and extension
support seem to change over time.

If you'd like to read the source code of the story, I recommend
either [viewing the source text online][] or cloning this repository,
downloading Inform 7 and loading it there.

This story makes use of the [Measured Liquid][] extension by Emily Short.
